# demo-app

Just a demo app :)

This project doesn't have any specific purpose nor it solves a particular problem. Some of the UX flows might be even
unfinished (mainly because I've just started with Jetpack Compose).

However, there are still some reasons behind the project:

* to demonstrate my skills, my code style and code conventions
* to experiment, try or simply play with the new/latest technologies
* to possibly adapt some of these approaches into my other (closed sourced :)) applications

Main focus on:

* Kotlin
* Coroutines
* Dagger & Hilt
* MVVM architecture
* Compose
* And other Jetpack libraries
